# Cows and Bulls Game:

Cows and Bulls is a game where you guess a 4 letter word. 

Let's say the word we're guessing is: SEAL

You can guess any word by typing it in. 

The program will tell you how many cows and bulls it has. 

There's a cow, if there's a shared character between your guess and the real word, but it's not in the correct position.  

There's a bull, if there's a shared character in your guess and the real word that IS in the correct position. 

Based on these clues, you need to ultimately guess the ultimate word! Good luck :)
